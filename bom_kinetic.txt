bom_kinetic

This program creates a CSV file that can be used to create a spreadsheet.
The grid from the spreadsheet can be copied and pasted into the Epicorp
Kinetic program to poplulate the BOM of a part.  This process automates
creating the BOM from an Eagle schematic without requiring manual entry of
BOM data.

The program must be run in the directory for the particular Eagle board.
The board name is assumed to be the directory leafname.

The <board>_bom.csv file is read.  This file is created by the BOM ULP in
Eagle, so this ULP must be run before the BOM_KINETIC program.

The program creates the KINETIC.CSV file.  This file is meant to be used
to create a spreadsheet.  On Windows, "kinetic.csv" can be run from the
command shell to automatically open Excel and import the data from the
file.  The contents of the resulting Excel grid (except for the column
headings line) can then be pasted into the Materials List in Kinetic. This
can be done by right clicking on the materials grid, then selecting Paste.

The first 5 column headings of the Materials list in Kinetic must be:

  Mtl   Part   Description   Qty/Parent   MfgComment

in that order.  The contents of the description column in the spreadsheet
does not matter since it is a "fixed field" in Kinetic, which is derived
from the part number (the "Part" field).
